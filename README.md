## My process

I started building this project by first finishing the markup with HTML and after that I started working on the CSS.
Since I go with the mobile first approach I started styling the generator to look good on mobile phones first and then I did the desktop version.
But as I was working on the JS I revisited both HTML and CSS files to add or remove certain parts.
But the main part of this project was in JS and that took a long time to complete, but nonetheless I learned a lot.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a ton from working on this project, and this was by far the biggest project JS wise for me. I learned how a sorting algorithm works, I also learned how to slice arrays to a given size based on the required amount of characters.

### Continued development

I will keep on learning JS and improve my skills with both HTML and CSS. But my main focus now will be working with objects and different higher order array methods.
